# /random    

# observe i have 3 folders named random at different leveles and in different folders
# the gitignore file is at my repo level ,and immediatley there , it has a folder named random so ,
# the /random will attack this rendom folder and not the random folder that is inside tkinter folder , 
# also because this random folder has a another random folder inside it , that also would be ignored (targeted)

# after doing operation with above value , it ignored the immdeate random folder , but uploaded the random folder inside the tkinter folder 
#also /random is same as /random/ slash at the end tells(confirms or implicates) that it is a folder/dir.

#now use 

random/


# The Problem:
# You are trying to ignore a folder (targetFolder/) using .gitignore, but it still appears in your GitHub repository.

# The Explanation:
# Git continues tracking the folder if it was added to the repository before .gitignore was configured.
# .gitignore only prevents new files from being tracked, not files that are already committed.
# A nested .gitignore file or misconfiguration could also affect the ignoring behavior.
# The Solution:
# Untrack the Folder:
# Run git rm -r --cached targetFolder/ to remove the folder from Git tracking while keeping it locally.
# Ensure Correct .gitignore Configuration:
# Make sure .gitignore contains targetFolder/ to ignore the folder.
# Commit and Push:
# Commit the changes and push them to GitHub with git commit -m "Remove targetFolder from version control" and git push origin main.
# This will remove the folder from GitHub and prevent it from being tracked.
