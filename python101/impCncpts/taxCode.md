#### Your Python program is functionally correct, but it has some improvements needed in terms of readability, maintainability, and scalability for an industry-level implementation.

- Issues & Improvements:
Hardcoded Tax Slabs

Storing slabs as a list or dictionary improves flexibility.
Avoid redundant variable assignments.
Repeated Print Statements

Instead of printing inside each condition, return the tax value and print once.
Variable Naming

Use meaningful variable names (e.g., income instead of usr).
Floating-Point Precision

Use round(tax, 2) to avoid excessive decimal places.
Industry-Level Enhancements

Encapsulate logic in a function that takes income as an argument.
Add error handling (e.g., checking for negative inputs).
Convert into a modular, reusable function for web applications.

        tax_slabs = [
            (400000, 0.05),
            (800000, 0.10),
            (1200000, 0.15),
            (1600000, 0.20),
            (2000000, 0.25),
            (2400000, 0.30),
        ]
        
        if income <= 400000:
            return 0  # No tax
        
        tax = 0
        prev_slab = 400000

        for slab, rate in tax_slabs:
            if income > slab:
                tax += (slab - prev_slab) * rate
                prev_slab = slab
            else:
                tax += (income - prev_slab) * rate
                break
        else:
            # Income above 24L, taxed at 30%
            tax += (income - prev_slab) * 0.30

        return round(tax, 2)

    # Get user input
    try:
        income = int(input("Enter your income: "))
        if income < 0:
            print("Income cannot be negative.")
        else:
            print(f"Your tax is: â‚¹{calculate_tax(income)}")
    except ValueError:
        print("Invalid input. Please enter a valid number.")

   Issues in Your Code
- Hard-Coded Slabs: Slabs are hard-coded, making future updates error-prone.

- No Input Validation: Crashes if the user enters non-numeric values.

- Repetitive Logic: Multiple elif blocks make the code harder to maintain.

- Lack of Security: Directly using input() is risky in web apps (vulnerable to code injection).

- No Error Handling: No try/catch for unexpected issues.

- Non-Scalable: Not designed to handle dynamic slab changes or localization (e.g., currency formatting).
